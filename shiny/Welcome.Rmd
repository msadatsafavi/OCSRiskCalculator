Welcome to this Web App! 

This Web app helps individuals who are using, or having using oral corticosteroids, to calculate their risk of adverse outcomes.

All the calculations in this application are based on a 2018 study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, by Sullivan and colleagues  ([Click here to access the publication poge](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.04.009). 


### Things to remember

#### This web app must be used in consultation with your care provider

#### This web app calculates the Relative Risk.
A relative increase of 50% means that compared with someone who is not taking oral corticosteroids, the risk is increased by 50%. The absolute value of change in risk is dependent on the baseline risk. For example, a 50% relative risk increase for someone with 2% risk is 3%. (that is, an extra 1%). However, for someone with 10%, the risk will be 15% (that is, an extra 5% of risk).

Your baseline risk is affected by many factors, such as your age and gender. Please carefully discuss your baseline risk with consultation with your care provider.
