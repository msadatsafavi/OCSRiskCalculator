### Cataract:
The background incidence of cataract was taken from [Waudby et a](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2415-11-32). In particular, their Figure 3 provides KM estimates by age which is helpful!

The values were digitized at 5-year intervals and then were interpolated, resulting in the following table

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::kable(evidence$ctc_risk_by_sex_age)

```


### Hypertension
[Robitaile et al](https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.101863) provides incidence by age and sex in Canada (see their Figure 3). 

For now I am approsimating the annual incidence by a function {((x-20)/80)^2/10}, which is a good approximation by now (and the incidence is similar between male and female)

```{r echo=FALSE}

knitr::kable(evidence$ctc_risk_by_sex_age)

```
